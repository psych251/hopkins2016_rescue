# Replication Project

Hello! My name is Howard.

I am currently a first-year PhD Student in the Graduate School of Education in the Developmental and Psychological Sciences program, and I am interested in using transdiagnostic longitudinal neuroimaging methods to understand the developmental trajectories of individuals within and across functional areas, so as to better understand how neural development relates to educational and other well-being outcomes.

This paper, and the seductive allure effect in general, is relevant to my interest in communicating scientific findings precisely and concisely. I might also be susceptible to this very effect in my own desire for explanations as I pivot from working as a school psychologist to neuroscience research as a PhD student.

If you have any questions or concerns about this course project, feel free to contact me or the instructor, Prof. Mike Frank.
