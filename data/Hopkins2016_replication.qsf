In galaxy formation, stars exert a gravitational pull on each other. When a spiral galaxy forms, the stars that are in the spiral arms of the galaxy are attracted by the gravitational pull of each star in the galaxy\u2019s central mass.

When people view rapidly presented images and are told to press a button every time they see a house, they are generally good at this. However, if two houses are presented close together, people often fail to press the button for the second house. This failure to detect the second house is called \u201cattentional blink.\u201d<\/span><\/span><br><br><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Why does the attentional blink effect happen?<\/span><\/span><\/strong><div><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/div><div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:\n&quot;\uff2d\uff33 \u660e\u671d&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\ncolor:#1F497D;mso-themecolor:text2;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:\nEN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\">The attentional blink effect occurs because of\nhow areas in the frontal lobe, previously shown to mediate attention, function\nin response to stimuli.

The second house appears later in the sequence than the first\nhouse, and the failure to notice it causes the attentional blink.<\/span>\n\n\n\n<\/div>","DataExportTag":"Y1-J-B-RB","QuestionID":"QID398"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_37SzaMtFw6pBFPM","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID431","SecondaryAttribute":"Earlier, you read the\n following phenomenon and explanation:\n\n \nThe\nHawaiian bobtail squid lives...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div><u><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Earlier, you read the following phenomenon and explanation:<\/span><\/strong><\/u><\/div><div><u><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br><\/span><\/strong><\/u><\/div><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">The Hawaiian bobtail squid lives in a symbiotic relationship with a species of bacteria known as Vibrio fischeri.

Antidepressants such\nas Prozac are known as \u2018selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\u2019 or SSRIs. They\ninhibit the reuptake of serotonin by blocking the mechanism that transports\nserotonin back into the neuron.

Crucially, the information that was included in these explanations did not actually contribute to the logic of the explanations. Neuroscience findings, especially those that make their way into the popular press, seem to be enormously interesting to people regardless of how solid (or shaky) the studies actually are. In other words, talking about brain activation seems to seduce people away from critically considering the underlying explanations that these findings offer. The study found that adding neuroscience information to both good and bad explanations indeed made it harder for people to tell the difference between the good and bad explanations.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial\"><o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The study in which you just took part expands on these previous studies to explore the ways in which people understand explanations across different sciences. The research team is looking to discover whether a similar effect exists in different sciences: Does bringing in information from other fields affect the way in which people understand a given explanation? The results from this survey will help to determine whether the seductive allure effect is unique to neuroscience or common across different sciences. That is, people may find any scientific explanation more satisfying if it includes information from a more fundamental science. If neuroscience information produces a seductive effect in a psychological explanation, then perhaps the same will occur when physics information is added to a chemistry explanation, for instance.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial\"><o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">We believe that this research has important implications for science education as well as for professional communication.
