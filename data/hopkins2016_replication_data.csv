Instead of using conduction heat, they use microwaves, which are a form of electro-magnetic radiation. One of the main advantages of microwave ovens over traditional ovens is speed. For example, it can take over an hour to cook a potato in an oven, but only about 5 minutes in a microwave. Why do microwaves work faster than conventional ovens?















In a traditional
oven, the heat that is generated initially only reaches the outside part of the
potato. In order for the potato to cook fully and be ready to eat, the heat has
to penetrate all the way to the center, which takes a long time. But
microwaves, unlike heat, can pass through the potato. The microwaves create
friction in the water inside the potato, which makes it heat up from the
inside. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","Microwave ovens cook food in an entirely different way than traditional ovens.

But crunching a piece of hard candy between your teeth may additionally release a spark of light for a brief moment. This effect is known as “triboluminescence.” It will happen with just about any type of hard candy, but it is particularly noticeable with wintergreen flavored mints.

Why is the triboluminescence effect stronger with wintergreen mints? 















When you bite down on the candy, you break the crystalline structure of the
sugars in the candy, releasing energy into the air. This energy is released as
both visible light and non-visible light. This effect is more apparent to the
eye with wintergreen mints because wintergreen oil absorbs the non-visible
light that is released and converts it to a more visible form. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","Usually, chewing food doesn’t have any effect other than to break the food down into smaller pieces.

The bacteria benefit from the relationship because they live inside the squid and receive necessary nutrients from it. The squid also benefits from the relationship: The bacteria protect the squid by helping to hide it from predators while it hunts at night.

Why are the bacteria able to protect the squid from predators? 















This type of bacteria live inside a special
organ inside the squid. When the concentration of the bacteria reaches a
certain threshold, it triggers a process that emits light. The light mimics the

When released from one neuron, serotonin binds with receptors on another and activates it. Lower levels of serotonin in the brain leads to less activation of these neurons. One class of antidepressants work by increasing the brain’s serotonin activity.

Why are serotonin-based treatments effective at combatting depression? 















Shortly after release, serotonin is reabsorbed
by the first neuron in a process known as reuptake. Antidepressants such as
Prozac inhibit the reuptake process by blocking the mechanism that transports
serotonin back into the neuron. Serotonin therefore stays in the synapse
longer, allowing for more activation of the postsynaptic neuron. This increase
in serotonin activity can relieve depressive symptoms for some patients. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","Some pharmaceutical drugs are designed to treat depression by affecting levels of serotonin, a chemical used by neurons in the brain for communication.

When people view rapidly presented images and are told to press a button every time they see a house, they are generally good at this. However, if two houses are presented close together, people often fail to press the button for the second house. This failure to detect the second house is called “attentional blink.”

Why does the attentional blink effect happen?















The attentional blink effect occurs because of
how people’s perceptual and decision-making abilities function in response to
the stimuli. People are limited in how many things they can pay attention to at
any given point in time. They generally miss seeing the second house because
they are still processing the first and do not have enough attentional

The shape of a galaxy
is determined by the way that it was formed. A ring-shaped galaxy used to be a
spiral galaxy. At some point in time, a smaller galaxy traveled through the

Why do wine diamonds form in cold wine?















Wine contains some ions
that come from the grape solids. Because warmer liquids contain more energy,
the water molecules in room-temperature wine move around and surround the ions.
The ions therefore cannot get close enough to each other to come together and

In order to gather important data about brain activity, such as a cognitive defect caused by a stroke, different brain scanning techniques can be employed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a crucial tool in the study of neuroscience. It allows for the measurement of patterns of activation by monitoring blood flow in an active brain.



​Why does fMRI use blood flow as an indicator of brain activity?















fMRI uses a magnetic field to measure relative
activity in different areas of the brain. Hemoglobin in blood that is carrying
oxygen has a different magnetic resonance than hemoglobin without oxygen.
Highly active brain areas can be detected using the magnetic field generated by
the fMRI machine. fMRI machines detect the flow of blood through the brain,
providing data about activity in each brain region. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","People generally have difficulty in telling two faces apart if they come from a race other than their own. For example, in the United States, white people are typically better at recognizing white faces than black faces. The finding that it is more difficult in general to recognize faces of races different from one’s own is known as “the other-race effect.”

​Why does the other-race effect occur?

 
















The other-race effect is caused by a difference
in the way that people respond to faces within a particular group. In
communities where the majority of the people are white, white faces are seen
more frequently than are those of other races. This greater experience with
white faces tunes the perceptual system to recognize greater detail across
those faces, making it easier to tell them apart. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","People generally have difficulty in telling two faces apart if they come from a race other than their own.

Why has the United States maintained a two-party system? 















The two major US
political parties are very well established, and both are opposed to competing

The light spectrums for elements in distant galaxies appear more red than the equivalent spectrums here on Earth. Because distant galaxies are most likely composed of the same materials as our galaxy, we would expect the spectrums to also be the same. Therefore, this “red shift” must occur because the galaxies are moving away from us.

​Why do distant galaxies appear red?















Distant galaxies appear red because, as galaxies
move away from us, each successive wave of light takes longer to arrive at the
Earth. This decrease in the frequency with which the waves arrive is equivalent
to an increase in the light’s wavelength. Longer-wavelength light looks more
red to us. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","The universe may be expanding.

However, despite their nearly identical makeup, their properties are very different. Graphite is soft, dark gray or black, and is used as an industrial lubricant to make machine parts more slippery. Diamond is extremely hard, colorless, and can be used in blades and abrasives for cutting or grinding other materials.

Why does carbon sometimes form soft graphite rather than hard diamond?















Graphite is made of layers of carbon that are arranged in 2-dimensional
sheets, which can easily slide sideways across each other. But the carbon that
makes up diamond is arranged in a rigid 3-dimensional structure that can’t easily
slide in any direction. Forming this rigid structure requires

However, their rate of head-bobbing also increases when they see another male lizard of the same species, even if no female lizards are present.

Why do male lizards bob their heads when other males are nearby?















This happens because the male lizards are
extremely territorial, and head-bobbing is a distinctive behavior typical of
this particular species of lizard. During mating season when they are in

In response to a painful stimulus, the body releases endorphins. Endorphins bind to neurons in the brain, causing dopamine to be released. Increased dopamine in the brain reduces the feeling of pain. Morphine can also bind to endorphin receptors and cause the release of dopamine. Although morphine is very effective, it is also highly addictive.

Why is morphine addictive?















Morphine is addictive because prolonged use
decreases the sensitivity of the endorphin receptors in the brain. Thus, the
body’s own endorphins become less effective, and the user experiences painful
withdrawal symptoms. Because the receptors become less sensitive to the drug,

In the 1990s, the city of Los Angeles had an especially bad problem with smog. Although smog was present nearly every day of the year, it appeared to be much denser and darker when the weather was hot.



Why does smog look denser when the weather is hot?
 

Smog contains two types of gas, one of which is dark brown (NO2) and the other of which is colorless (N2O4). The reaction that makes the dark brown gas needs energy to happen. Higher temperatures provide greater thermal energy. So more of the brown gas and less of the colorless gas is formed on hot days, making the air look darker. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","Smog is a type of air pollution that makes breathing difficult and reduces how far one can see into the distance.

People who wear blue-light blocking glasses for 3 hours before going to bed have higher sleep quality and better mood than people who don’t.

Why does blue light disrupt sleep cycles?















Sleep cycles are governed by a part of the brain
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receives input from the eyes
and is sensitive to light. It also produces a hormone important for regulating
sleep patterns. When it reaches the eye, blue light triggers the suppression of
the SCN’s production of this hormone. Lower levels of the hormone interfere
with the ability to regulate sleep. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","Exposure to artificial light may be disruptive to sleep.

called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receives input from the eyes
and is sensitive to light. It also produces a hormone important for normal
functioning. When it reaches the eye,
blue light interferes with the body’s normal rhythms and disrupts sleep

Why does blue light disrupt sleep cycles?















Sleep cycles are governed by a part of the brain
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receives input from the eyes
and is sensitive to light. It produces melatonin, a hormone important for
regulating sleep patterns. When absorbed
by a photopigment in the eye, blue light triggers the suppression of the SCN’s
production of this hormone. Lower levels of the hormone interfere with sleep
regulation. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","Exposure to artificial light may be disruptive to sleep.

For example, babies see a doll placed on a stage that is then hidden behind a screen. Then, they see a hand place another doll behind the screen. They look longer if the screen is dropped to reveal only one doll instead of two. This looking time difference between one and two dolls shows that babies can calculate 1 + 1 = 2.

Why does this looking time difference show that babies can do arithmetic?















Babies’ understanding of numbers and mathematics
starts to emerge early in their lives. This understanding of numbers governs
the babies’ expectations about how many dolls there should be on the stage. The
babies know that there should be two dolls on the stage, and their surprise at
seeing only one leads to their looking longer. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","Babies are capable of doing simple arithmetic.

When steps are taken to prevent petty crimes, the rate of major crimes goes down as well, even if nothing is done to specifically prevent major crimes. This has been called the “broken windows” theory of crime.

Why does cleaning up vandalism and graffiti reduce crime rates of major crime?















When a neighborhood
is not kept clean, this is taken as an indication of low police presence in the
area. Therefore, this neighborhood comes to be seen as somewhere major crimes
can be committed without risk of being caught. However, maintaining the
neighborhood by cleaning up graffiti and replacing broken windows leads to the perception
of an increased police presence. This perception works as a deterrent against
all criminal activity, including major crimes. - How would you rate the quality of this explanation?","Neighborhoods with visible petty crime, such as vandalism and graffiti, tend to also have higher levels of major crime, such as robbery and murder.
